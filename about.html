<p>Fourth-year undergrad student at UC Berkeley, majoring in Computer Science. I love designing, developing, and creating awesome experiences for users. Most of my experience is with desktop and mobile web applications, but right now I'm learning iOS development.</p>

<p>Besides tech, I am really into teaching, mentoring, entrepreneurship, and learning and practicing leadership and public speaking skills. I'm quite a curious person. I want to understand how things work — my friends know me as the person who always asks "why?"</p>

<p>After graduation, I will be joining Google as a software engineering in August. Summer, I'll be traveling the world. Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam, and the Amazon Rainforest are on my list. Come join me!</p>
