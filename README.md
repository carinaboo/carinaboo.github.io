Personal website in the works!

I just started learning and using Jekyll. It's pretty awesome way to get a blog started up quickly, and hosted by Github! 

I'll be making and sharing my own Jekyll themes soon. This particular theme was adopted from Start Bootstrap's [Clean Blog](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/) theme.
